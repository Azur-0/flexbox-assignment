# flexbox-assignment

I'll be creating a webpage that looks the same as image '01.png' in 'images' folder.
This is an assignement from TheOdinProject course to test flexbox skills.

UPDATE:
It can definitely be done better but I don't think it's that bad for a first time. 
Assignment also said to not worry about making it look good on mobile, that'll come later.
Took me 2 hours from start to finish.
